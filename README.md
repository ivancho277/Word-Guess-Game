# Word-Guess-Game

##Description
This will be a simple javascript game that plays a simple themed game of hangman with the user. The program will show a number of blank spaces to represent letters that the user must guess, and will appear if guessed correctly. There will be a limited number of guesses.

This game strengthened my abilities to:
* use basic loops
* understand basic Javascript syntax
* understand the fundamentals of functional programming
* write basic algorithms
* dynamically update our HTML with Javascript
* learn an assortment of standard Javascript built in functions
* No external JS librar's were used (except for any bootstrap may require)
* more experience with using bootstraps CSS styling library
* experience debugging JS programs with google dev tools using the degbugger and console.logs
